IA-HASH

IA-HASH is an open, model-agnostic standard for signing and verifying pairs of Prompt + Response generated by any Large Language Model (LLM).

It provides a minimal and practical way to guarantee:

Integrity — The prompt and response have not been modified.

Authenticity — The document was issued by a real IA-HASH issuer (via private key signature).

Reproducibility — Anyone can re-hash and verify the result.

Auditability — Documents remain verifiable even offline or years later.

IA-HASH does not depend on any AI provider, blockchain, or proprietary SDK.
It is lightweight, transparent and future-proof.

⭐ Why IA-HASH?

As AI assistants become part of personal, business and legal workflows, we need a way to prove that a model actually generated a given output without modification, editing, or falsification.

IA-HASH solves this with three principles:

Hash the prompt

Hash the response

Sign a combined hash using the issuer’s private key

Anyone with the issuer’s public key can later verify integrity and authenticity.

Typical use cases

Verified AI-generated CVs

Psychological or personality assessments

Technical evaluations

AI-generated reports

Educational or training assessments

Internal company audits

Personal AI assistants (logs, summaries, reflections)

🔧 How IA-HASH works (minimal protocol)
1. Normalize text
prompt_normalized = bytes(prompt, "utf-8")
response_normalized = bytes(response, "utf-8")

2. Hash both parts
h_prompt = SHA256(prompt_normalized)
h_response = SHA256(response_normalized)

3. Compute the combined hash
h_total = SHA256(
    version + "|" +
    prompt_id + "|" +
    h_prompt + "|" +
    h_response + "|" +
    model + "|" +
    timestamp
)

4. Sign h_total using the issuer’s private key (Ed25519 recommended)
signature = sign(private_key, h_total)

5. Bundle everything into an IA-HASH Document

This document can later be verified without accessing the original issuer.

📄 IA-HASH Document Example
{
  "version": "IA-HASH-1",
  "prompt_id": "CV_v01",
  "prompt_description": "Write the most honest CV about the user...",
  "response": "Here is the content generated by the AI...",
  "model": "gpt-5.1-thinking",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T15:32:11Z",
  "subject": "manu_cabral",

  "h_prompt": "df91fa...",
  "h_response": "a01bcd...",
  "h_total": "9e0041...",  

  "issuer_id": "IAHASH-001",
  "issuer_url": "https://ia-hash.com/public-key.pem"
}

🚀 Installation
git clone https://github.com/IAHASH/iahash
cd iahash
pip install -r requirements.txt


Generate your keypair:

python scripts/generate_keys.py


Issue a signed IA-HASH document:

python scripts/demo_issue_verify.py

🔍 Verification

Send the full IA-HASH document returned by the issuer:

python scripts/demo_issue_verify.py --verify


Or via API:

curl -X POST https://your-domain/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @document.json

🧬 Vision

IA-HASH aims to become a lightweight, universal format for trustworthy AI-generated text.

No vendor lock-in

No hidden constraints

No dependency on AI providers

Just clean, verifiable, auditable output
