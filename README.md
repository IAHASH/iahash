# IA-HASH

**IA-HASH is an open, model-agnostic standard for signing and verifying pairs of
**Prompt + Response** generated by any Large Language Model (LLM).**

It provides a minimal and practical way to guarantee:

- **Integrity**: the prompt and response have not been modified.
- **Authenticity**: the document was issued by a real IA-HASH issuer (via private key signature).
- **Reproducibility**: anyone can re-hash and verify the result.
- **Auditability**: documents remain verifiable even offline or years later.

IA-HASH does **not** depend on any AI provider, blockchain, or proprietary SDK.  
It is designed to be **simple**, **transparent**, and **future-proof**.

## ✨ Why IA-HASH?

As AI assistants become part of personal, business, and legal workflows, we need a
way to **prove that a model actually generated a given output**, without allowing
modification, editing, or falsification.

IA-HASH solves this with three principles:

1. **Hash the prompt**  
2. **Hash the response**  
3. **Sign a combined hash with the issuer’s private key**

Anyone with the public key can later verify integrity and authenticity.

This makes IA-HASH ideal for:

- Verified AI-generated CVs  
- Psychological or personality assessments  
- Technical evaluations  
- AI-generated reports  
- Educational or training assessments  
- Internal company audits  
- Personal AI assistants (e.g., life-logs, reflections, summaries)
